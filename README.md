# PRNGs

As part of an Undergraduate Research Project I investigated pseudo random number generators (PRNG) in Python, R and C++. The aim of the investigation was to understand how the languages go about generating random numbers, how they then go onto generate samples from a uniform distribution, with the intention at the end to provide frameworks to allows to align the generation of uniform variates across the languages.
